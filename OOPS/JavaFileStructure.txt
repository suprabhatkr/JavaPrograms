There are several classes:
class A{}
class B{}
class C{}
class D{}
In the above case, we can name it any name like example.java
A java program should contains atmost one public class, although can have any number of classes.

If there is  public class, then filename should be that class name only. So, if we make our B class public, then we need to name it as B.java . 

Class having main function and filename has no relation. 

Class A{
	P S main(String() args){
		Super("A class main");
	}
}
Class B{
	P S main(String() args){
		Super("B class main");				
	}				
}							
Class C{
	P S main(String() args)
	{
		Super("C class main");
	}
}
Class D{
}

When we will run javac filename.java (as filename can be anything as no public class), then it will form 4 classes A.class,B.class,C.class,D.class So when I will run java A then main function of main will run main method of A and so for C and D. 

If we will run java D, it will also give us error. And we will also get error for java filename.java 

Points of this lecture:
1. There can be atmost one public class in a file. 
2. In case of no public class, file can be named anything .
3. If many non public class has main file, then we will have to run all the classes which contains main separately. 
4. Any class not containing main will give error in case of point no 3
5. For naming the file, public class need not contains main file, but without main file, running the class will give error. Although no error will be in compiling the file. 
6. Only classes containing main class can run.
